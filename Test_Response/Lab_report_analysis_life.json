    "final_recommendation": "**Standard Rate with Health Exclusions**\n\nMr. Hardik Agarwal presents with multiple moderate health risks that warrant attention but do not necessarily disqualify him from life insurance coverage. His pre-diabetic status (HbA1c 5.9%), borderline high cholesterol profile, and vitamin D deficiency represent modifiable risk factors that could impact long-term health outcomes if not addressed.\n\nRecommend offering coverage at standard rates with potential exclusions or riders related to diabetes and cardiovascular conditions. The applicant should be encouraged to follow up with appropriate medical care to address the identified health concerns.\n\nConsider requesting follow-up testing in 6-12 months to monitor progression of pre-diabetes and cholesterol levels, which could potentially lead to rate improvement if values normalize.",
