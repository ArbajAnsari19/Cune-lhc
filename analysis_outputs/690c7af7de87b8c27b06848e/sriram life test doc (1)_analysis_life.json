Resolve the name discrepancy between 'Hardil' and 'Hardik' Agarwal\n2. Obtain complete medical information including height, weight, and BMI\n3. Request more details about the hospitalization episode from 2 years ago\n4. Obtain information about the plan details, coverage amount, and beneficiary information\n\nThe applicant's income level supports a substantial coverage amount (potentially 5-10x annual income), and the occupation in service sector generally presents standard risk. Once the missing information is provided and the name discrepancy is resolved, this application could likely proceed with standard rates.",
