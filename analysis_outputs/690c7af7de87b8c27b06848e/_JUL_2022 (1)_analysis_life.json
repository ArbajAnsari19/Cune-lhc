    "overall_summary": "This document is a salary slip for Hardik Agarwal for July 2022 from JM Financial Services Limited. The employee works as an Assistant Vice President in the Digital Broking department and joined the company on March 7, 2022. The salary slip shows a gross monthly income of ₹238,000 with deductions totaling ₹65,097, resulting in a net pay of ₹172,903. For life insurance underwriting, this document provides valuable income verification showing substantial earning capacity (annual gross income of approximately ₹2,856,000), which supports premium payment ability and justifies a significant coverage amount (potentially 5-10x annual income or ₹14-28 million). The financial services industry employment and AVP position indicate a white-collar occupation with standard mortality risk. The recent employment start date (4 months prior to this slip) may indicate a career transition that warrants verification of employment stability.",
