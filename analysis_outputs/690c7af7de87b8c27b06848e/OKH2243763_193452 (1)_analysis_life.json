    "overall_summary": "This document is a comprehensive medical laboratory report for Mr. Hardik Agarwal, a 31-year-old male. The report contains results from multiple tests including complete blood count, lipid profile, liver function tests, kidney function tests, thyroid function, vitamin D levels, blood glucose, and urinalysis. The tests were conducted by TATA 1MG OKHLA laboratory. The report indicates several health concerns including borderline high HbA1c (5.9%, indicating pre-diabetes risk), elevated total cholesterol (210 mg/dL), elevated LDL cholesterol (128 mg/dL), vitamin D deficiency (19.5 ng/ml), and slightly elevated ESR (18 mm/hr). These findings are relevant for life insurance underwriting as they indicate potential health risks that could affect mortality risk assessment.",

    "final_recommendation": "## Underwriting Recommendation\n\nBased on the laboratory results for Mr. Hardik Agarwal, I recommend **standard rates with a potential rating** for this 31-year-old male applicant.\n\n### Key Findings Affecting Risk Assessment:\n\n1. **Pre-diabetes Risk**: HbA1c of 5.9% indicates pre-diabetes, which may increase future risk of developing diabetes and associated cardiovascular complications.\n\n2. **Elevated Cholesterol**: Total cholesterol (210 mg/dL) and LDL cholesterol (128 mg/dL) are elevated, increasing cardiovascular risk.\n\n3. **Multiple Minor Issues**: Vitamin D deficiency, elevated ESR, and slightly elevated liver enzymes individually represent low risks but collectively may indicate underlying health concerns.\n\n### Recommended Actions:\n\n1. **Medical Records**: Request complete medical records to determine if these conditions are being monitored or treated.\n\n2. **Follow-up Testing**: Consider requesting follow-up testing in 3-6 months to establish if these values are trending up or down, particularly for HbA1c and lipid profile.\n\n3. **Attending Physician Statement**: Obtain an APS to determine if the applicant has been diagnosed with any conditions related to these laboratory findings.\n\n4. **Lifestyle Assessment**: Gather additional information about diet, exercise habits, and family history of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\n\nWhile none of these findings alone would typically warrant a significant rating, the combination of pre-diabetes markers and elevated cholesterol in a relatively young individual suggests increased long-term mortality risk that should be factored into underwriting decisions.",
