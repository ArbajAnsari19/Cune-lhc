## Executive Summary

Analysis of seven documents for Hardik Agarwal reveals a 29-31 year old male Assistant Vice President at JM Financial Services with an annual income of approximately ₹2,856,000-3,000,000. The application shows potential health concerns and identity verification issues that require additional information before final underwriting decision can be made.

## Risk Patterns

Primary risks include health indicators (Medium), identity verification inconsistencies (Medium), and employment stability (Low). Health risks center around pre-diabetes markers (HbA1c 5.9%), elevated cholesterol levels, and minor vitamin deficiencies. Identity documents show name spelling variations and limited tenure (joined March 2022) at current employer suggests potential income stability concerns despite high compensation level.

## Critical Discrepancies & Concerns

1. **Name inconsistency across documents**
   * Application shows "Hardil Agarwal" while signature and other documents show "Hardik Agarwal"
   * Requires verification of legal name for policy issuance

2. **Pre-diabetes indicators without medical context**
   * HbA1c of 5.9% (above normal range of 4-5.6%) indicates pre-diabetes risk
   * No information on whether condition is being monitored or treated

3. **Cardiovascular risk factors**
   * Elevated total cholesterol (210 mg/dL) and LDL cholesterol (128 mg/dL)
   * Multiple minor health issues (vitamin D deficiency, elevated ESR, slightly elevated liver enzymes)

4. **Limited employment history documentation**
   * Salary slips show employment beginning March 2022, providing only 6-7 months of history
   * No previous employment verification to establish longer financial stability

5. **Incomplete medical information**
   * Height and weight measurements not provided in application
   * Limited details about hospitalization episode from 2 years ago for fever

## Underwriting Decision

**Request Additional Information**

* Current medical information is concerning but insufficient for final decision - need physician statement regarding pre-diabetes markers and cholesterol levels
* Name discrepancy between application ("Hardil") and signature/documents ("Hardik") must be resolved before policy issuance
* Additional employment history verification needed to establish financial stability beyond current position (started March 2022)

## Portfolio-Level Insights

* Application shows moderate confidence level (average 0.77 across documents) with strongest confidence in financial documentation (0.85-0.9) and weakest in identification verification (0.4-0.8)
* Risk mitigation opportunity exists through lifestyle counseling regarding pre-diabetes management and cholesterol reduction
* Financial capacity is strong with income supporting substantial coverage (5-10x annual income or ₹14-30 million)
* Medical underwriting should focus on cardiovascular risk assessment given the combination of pre-diabetes markers and elevated cholesterol
