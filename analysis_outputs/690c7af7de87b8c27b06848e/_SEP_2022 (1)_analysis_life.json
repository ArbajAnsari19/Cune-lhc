    "overall_summary": "This document is a salary slip from JM FINANCIAL SERVICES LIMITED for employee HARDIK AGARWAL for September 2022. The employee holds the position of Assistant Vice President in the Digital Broking department and joined the company on March 7, 2022. The salary slip shows a gross monthly income of ₹238,000 with deductions totaling ₹65,097, resulting in a net pay of ₹172,903. For life insurance underwriting, this document provides valuable income verification showing substantial earning capacity (annual income of approximately ₹2,856,000), confirming the applicant's ability to pay insurance premiums. The position as AVP in financial services indicates a white-collar occupation with minimal physical hazards but potentially high stress levels. The income level supports a significant life insurance coverage amount (potentially 5-10x annual income, suggesting coverage of ₹14-28 million would be appropriate). The document also confirms stable employment, though relatively recent with the current employer (approximately 6 months at the time of this slip).",

Based on the monthly income of ₹238,000 (annual income approximately ₹2,856,000), a life insurance coverage of 5-10x annual income (₹14-28 million) would be appropriate and financially justified.\n\nThe applicant has a stable white-collar position as Assistant Vice President in Digital Broking at JM Financial Services Limited, which presents minimal physical occupational hazards. While financial services roles can involve high stress levels, this alone doesn't significantly impact mortality risk.\n\nThe employment tenure is relatively recent (joined March 2022), but the senior position and substantial compensation suggest career stability and financial responsibility. The consistent income pattern (full 30 days worked) and formal employment with benefits (PF contributions) further support the applicant's reliability for premium payments.\n\nRecommend proceeding with standard rates based on this financial assessment, subject to normal medical underwriting protocols based on age and coverage amount requested.",
