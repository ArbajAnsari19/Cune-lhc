    "overall_summary": "This document appears to be an identification document containing basic personal information for Hardik Agarwal. The extracted data includes the individual's name, date of birth (27/03/1994), gender (male), and Aadhaar number (592455052947). This is not a salary slip or invoice, but rather appears to be a government identification document (Aadhaar card) from India. For life insurance underwriting, this document provides basic identity verification and age confirmation, which are fundamental for determining premium rates and policy eligibility. The applicant is a 29-year-old male based on the date of birth provided.",

The following additional documents are essential:\n\n1. Completed life insurance application form\n2. Medical examination reports or health questionnaire\n3. Income verification documents to assess premium payment capacity and appropriate coverage amount\n4. Lifestyle questionnaire to evaluate risk factors\n5. Beneficiary designation information\n\nThe applicant's age (29) places him in a generally favorable age bracket for life insurance, but no underwriting decision can be made without comprehensive health, lifestyle, and financial information.",
