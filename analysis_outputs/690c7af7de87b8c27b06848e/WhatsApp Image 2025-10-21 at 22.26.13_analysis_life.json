    "overall_summary": "This document appears to be a Permanent Account Number (PAN) card issued by the Income Tax Department of India for Hardik Agarwal. The PAN card is an important identification document in India that serves as proof of identity and is used for tax purposes. For life insurance underwriting, this document provides basic identification information including the applicant's full name, father's name, and date of birth. The applicant was born on March 27, 1994, making him approximately 29 years old. This document serves primarily as identity verification rather than providing health, financial, or lifestyle information directly relevant to risk assessment.",

Request medical examination and health history questionnaire to assess health status and risks\n2. Obtain income verification documents (salary slips, tax returns) to determine appropriate coverage amount and premium payment capacity\n3. Request lifestyle questionnaire to assess risk behaviors (smoking, alcohol use, dangerous activities)\n4. Verify occupation details to assess occupation-related risks\n5. Collect information on desired coverage amount and beneficiary designations\n\nThe application cannot proceed with underwriting until these additional documents are provided.",
