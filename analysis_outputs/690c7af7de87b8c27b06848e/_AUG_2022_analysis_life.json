    "overall_summary": "This document is a salary slip for Hardik Agarwal, an Assistant Vice President at JM Financial Services Limited, for August 2022. The salary slip provides valuable income verification for life insurance underwriting, showing a gross monthly income of ₹238,000 and net pay of ₹172,903 after deductions. The applicant has been employed since March 7, 2022 (approximately 5 months at the time of this salary slip), working in the Digital Broking department. The document confirms stable employment in a financial services company, which typically represents a lower-risk occupation category for life insurance. The high income level (annual gross of approximately ₹2,856,000 or $35,000-40,000 USD) suggests capacity to pay insurance premiums and justifies a substantial coverage amount (typically 5-10x annual income would be ₹14-28 million). The document also provides verification of identity through PAN, Aadhaar, and bank account details.",

    "final_recommendation": "**Approve** for life insurance coverage with the following considerations:\n\n1. **Premium Payment Capacity**: The applicant demonstrates strong financial capacity with a monthly gross income of ₹238,000 (annual ₹2,856,000), which easily supports premium payments for substantial coverage.\n\n2. **Coverage Amount Justification**: Based on the 5-10x annual income guideline, coverage between ₹14-28 million would be appropriate. If the requested coverage falls within this range, it is financially justified.\n\n3. **Occupation Risk**: The applicant works in Digital Broking as an Assistant Vice President, which is generally a low physical risk occupation but may involve high stress. Standard rates apply without occupation surcharge.\n\n4. **Financial Stability**: Despite relatively short tenure (5 months at time of slip), the senior position (AVP) and substantial salary indicate career stability and financial responsibility.\n\n5. **Identity Verification**: The document provides multiple verification points (PAN, Aadhaar, bank details) that should be cross-referenced with the application for fraud prevention.\n\nRecommend standard rates with no additional loading based on financial information provided.",
