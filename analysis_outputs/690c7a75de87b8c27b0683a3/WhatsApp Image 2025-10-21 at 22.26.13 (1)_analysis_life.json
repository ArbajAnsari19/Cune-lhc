    "overall_summary": "This document appears to be a basic identification document containing personal information for Hardik Agarwal, a 29-year-old male born on March 27, 1994, with Aadhaar number 592455052947. This is not a salary slip or invoice but rather an identity verification document that would be part of a life insurance application process. The Aadhaar number is India's unique identification number, similar to a Social Security Number in the US, which is commonly required for insurance applications in India. The document provides basic demographic information but lacks medical history, lifestyle factors, or coverage details needed for a comprehensive life insurance underwriting assessment.",

Complete medical history questionnaire and records\n2. Lifestyle questionnaire (smoking status, alcohol consumption, exercise habits)\n3. Occupation details and income verification\n4. Desired coverage amount and beneficiary information\n5. Any existing life insurance policies\n\nThe application cannot proceed until these critical underwriting factors are obtained to properly assess mortality risk and appropriate coverage levels.",
