## Executive Summary

Analysis of 2 identification documents for Hardik Agarwal, a 29-year-old male born on March 27, 1994. The application cannot proceed as submitted due to insufficient information for proper life insurance underwriting assessment, with only basic identity verification provided.

## Risk Patterns

Primary risks include insufficient documentation (Medium) and inability to assess mortality risk (Medium). The application package contains only identity verification documents (Aadhaar card and PAN card) without any health, lifestyle, financial, or coverage information necessary for life insurance underwriting.

## Critical Discrepancies & Concerns

1. Absence of medical information
   * No health history, current conditions, or family medical history provided
   * Unable to assess mortality risk factors or potential pre-existing conditions

2. Missing lifestyle data
   * No information on smoking status, alcohol consumption, or high-risk activities
   * Cannot evaluate behavioral risk factors that impact life insurance pricing

3. Lack of financial documentation
   * No income verification or occupation details included
   * Unable to assess premium payment capacity or appropriate coverage amount

4. Incomplete application materials
   * No requested coverage amount or beneficiary designations
   * Missing information about existing life insurance policies

## Underwriting Decision

**Request Additional Information**

* Current documentation is limited to identity verification only and insufficient for risk assessment
* Require complete medical questionnaire, health records, lifestyle information, and financial documentation
* Application cannot proceed until comprehensive underwriting data is received to properly evaluate mortality risk

## Portfolio-Level Insights

* Low confidence in application package (0.6/1.0) due to minimal documentation provided
* Identity verification is complete and consistent across both documents
* Application appears to be in preliminary stages with only basic identification submitted
* Underwriting team should request a complete application package with standard medical and financial documentation

## Document-Specific Summary Table

| Document | Primary Purpose | Key Finding | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| Aadhaar Card | Identity verification | Confirms basic demographic information | Insufficient alone for underwriting |
| PAN Card | Tax/identity verification | Verifies name, date of birth, and father's name | Additional documentation required |

Overall, while the applicant's identity is well-established, the application lacks all substantive information required for life insurance underwriting assessment.
