# Consolidated Life Insurance Underwriting Analysis

## Executive Summary

The application package for Hardik Agarwal (also appearing as "Hardil" in one document) consists of three identification and application documents: an Aadhaar card (India's national ID), a Permanent Account Number (PAN) card issued by India's Income Tax Department, and an incomplete life insurance application form from Shriram Life Insurance Company Limited. The applicant appears to be a male between 29-31 years old (with age discrepancies across documents), employed in a service role with an annual income of Rs. 3,000,000.

The documentation provided is significantly incomplete for proper life insurance underwriting. While basic identification information is available through government-issued ID cards, the insurance application itself contains critical gaps including missing policy details, incomplete medical information, and absent beneficiary data. Additionally, concerning discrepancies exist regarding the applicant's name spelling, age/date of birth, and a future-dated declaration on the application form. The only medical information provided indicates a hospitalization for fever approximately two years ago, but lacks sufficient detail for risk assessment.

   - Family medical history
   - Medical examination results
3. **Policy and coverage details**:

   - Current contact information including address, phone, email
5. **Financial and beneficiary information**:
   - Income verification documentation
   - Beneficiary/nominee details
   - Financial justification for coverage amount
6. **Lifestyle information**:

## Portfolio-Level Insights

### Overall Confidence Assessment
- **Confidence Score**: Low (0.65 average across documents)

- Government ID documents appear legitimate but insurance application has integrity concerns

### Cross-Document Red Flags

- Significant gaps in required underwriting information

### Risk Mitigation Opportunities
1. Request a face-to-face interview with the applicant to verify identity and resolve discrepancies
2. Require a comprehensive medical examination to establish current health status
3. Implement enhanced due diligence given the documentation inconsistencies
4. Consider requesting attestation from a local agent to verify applicant's identity

### Next Steps for Underwriting Team
1. Issue a formal request for additional information with detailed checklist
2. Flag application for enhanced review once complete information is received
3. Verify authenticity of government ID documents through appropriate channels
4. Consider telephone verification with applicant to clarify basic discrepancies
5. Set 30-day deadline for receipt of complete information before closing application
