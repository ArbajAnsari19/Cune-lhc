    "overall_summary": "The document appears to be a Permanent Account Number (PAN) card issued by the Income Tax Department of India for Hardik Agarwal. This is an identification document rather than a salary slip or invoice. The PAN card contains basic personal information including the individual's name, father's name, date of birth, PAN number, and issue date. For life insurance underwriting, this document serves primarily as identity verification and helps establish the applicant's age (currently 29 years old based on the DOB of 27/03/1994). While this document provides basic identification information, it does not contain medical history, lifestyle factors, coverage details, or financial information needed for comprehensive life insurance underwriting.",

    "final_recommendation": "**Additional Documentation Required**\n\nThe PAN card provides basic identity verification but is insufficient for life insurance underwriting decisions. Recommend:\n\n1. Request standard medical examination and health questionnaire to assess medical risks\n2. Obtain income verification documents (salary slips, tax returns) to determine appropriate coverage amount and premium payment capacity\n3. Request lifestyle questionnaire to assess risk behaviors\n4. Obtain details about desired coverage amount and beneficiary information\n5. Verify occupation and employment details for occupation-based risk assessment\n\nUntil this additional information is provided, no underwriting decision can be made as the current document only serves for identity verification purposes.",
