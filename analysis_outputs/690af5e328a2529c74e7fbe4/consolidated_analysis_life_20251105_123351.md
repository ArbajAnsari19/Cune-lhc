## Executive Summary

Analysis of four documents for Hardik Agarwal, a 31-year-old male seeking life insurance coverage. The application shows potential health concerns but requires additional information regarding medical history, lifestyle factors, and plan details before a final underwriting decision can be made.

## Risk Patterns

Primary risks include incomplete medical documentation (High), pre-diabetes indicators (Medium), cardiovascular risk factors (Low), and insufficient lifestyle information (Medium). The pattern suggests early metabolic concerns that require monitoring but do not present severe immediate risk. The applicant's income level (Rs. 3,000,000 annually) indicates good premium payment capacity, though this must be balanced against the identified health concerns.

## Critical Discrepancies & Concerns

1. **Identity verification inconsistencies**
   * Name appears as both "Hardil Agarwal" and "Hardik Agarwal" across documents
   * Missing signatures on application form where required

2. **Medical disclosure gaps**
   * Laboratory results show pre-diabetes (HbA1c 5.9%) and borderline cholesterol (210 mg/dL)
   * No height/weight measurements to calculate BMI, especially concerning with pre-diabetes indicators
   * Prior hospitalization for fever mentioned without supporting medical documentation

3. **Incomplete application details**
   * Missing coverage amount and plan specifications
   * No nominee/beneficiary information provided
   * Incomplete signatures on required forms

4. **Lifestyle factor omissions**
   * No information about smoking status, alcohol consumption, or exercise habits
   * Missing details about occupation-specific hazards or high-risk activities

5. **Limited family medical history**
   * Form indicates parents and siblings are alive but lacks details on family history of diabetes, heart disease, or other hereditary conditions

## Underwriting Decision

**Request Additional Information**

* Current medical findings show pre-diabetes and borderline cholesterol levels that require further assessment but don't warrant outright decline
* Request complete medical examination including height/weight measurements, physician's report, and clarification on prior hospitalization
* Require lifestyle questionnaire, properly completed application with coverage details, beneficiary information, and verification of correct legal name

## Portfolio-Level Insights

* The application has moderate confidence level (0.7-0.9 across documents) with laboratory results providing the most reliable health information
* Risk mitigation opportunity exists through wellness program participation to address pre-diabetes and cholesterol concerns
* The applicant's stable employment and good income level suggest positive premium payment capacity
* Recommend expedited follow-up to resolve documentation gaps while maintaining customer engagement
* Consider Standard Plus rating once all information is received, based on current medical findings

## Document-Specific Summary Table

| Document | Primary Purpose | Key Finding | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| Aadhaar Card | Identity verification | Confirms basic identity details | Accept as valid ID proof |
| PAN Card | Secondary identity verification | Confirms tax registration status | Accept as supporting documentation |
| Medical Laboratory Report | Health risk assessment | Shows pre-diabetes and borderline cholesterol | Request follow-up tests in 12 months |
| Life Insurance Proposal Form | Application details | Incomplete information with prior hospitalization noted | Request complete form with missing details |

Overall, the applicant presents a potentially insurable risk at Standard Plus rates once all documentation gaps are addressed and medical findings are fully evaluated.
