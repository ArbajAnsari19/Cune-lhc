Request complete medical information including height, weight, and BMI calculation\n2. Obtain clarification on the name discrepancy (Hardil vs. Hardik Agarwal)\n3. Request plan details including desired coverage amount to assess appropriateness relative to income\n4. Obtain nominee/beneficiary information\n5. Request properly completed signatures on the form\n6. Verify employment details with additional documentation\n\nThe hospitalization for fever 2 years ago appears to be an acute, resolved issue rather than a chronic condition and likely poses minimal risk. The applicant's income level suggests good premium payment capacity. Once the missing information is provided, this appears to be a potentially standard risk case.",
