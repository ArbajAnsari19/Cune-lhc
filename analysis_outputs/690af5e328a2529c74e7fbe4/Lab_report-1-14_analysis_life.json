    "overall_summary": "This document is a comprehensive medical laboratory report for Mr. Hardik Agarwal, a 31-year-old male. The report includes multiple test results including complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood sugar, lipid profile, liver function tests, kidney function tests, thyroid function tests, vitamin D levels, and urinalysis. The report indicates several health concerns relevant for life insurance underwriting, including pre-diabetes (HbA1c of 5.9%, above normal range), elevated ESR (18 mm/hr, above reference range of 0-10), borderline high total cholesterol (210 mg/dL), and vitamin D deficiency (19.5 ng/ml).",

    "final_recommendation": "## Underwriting Recommendation\n\nBased on the comprehensive laboratory results for Mr. Hardik Agarwal, I recommend **Standard Plus rating** for life insurance coverage with the following considerations:\n\n### Key Findings:\n\n1. **Pre-diabetes risk**: The applicant's HbA1c of 5.9% falls in the pre-diabetes range, indicating increased risk for developing diabetes in the future. This requires careful consideration but does not warrant severe rating at this time.\n\n2. **Cardiovascular risk factors**: Borderline elevated cholesterol levels suggest mild cardiovascular risk that should be monitored.\n\n3. **Multiple minor health concerns**: Elevated ESR, vitamin D deficiency, and high-normal liver enzymes individually present low risk but collectively suggest the need for monitoring.\n\n### Recommendation Details:\n\n- **Coverage approval**: Approve coverage with slight premium adjustment (Standard Plus rather than Preferred)\n- **Follow-up requirements**: Consider requesting follow-up laboratory tests in 12 months to monitor pre-diabetes progression\n- **Exclusions**: No specific exclusions warranted based on current findings\n- **Risk mitigation**: Encourage lifestyle modifications through wellness program participation\n\nThe applicant's overall health profile shows early metabolic concerns that may progress over time but currently present moderate risk that can be accommodated through appropriate rating.",
