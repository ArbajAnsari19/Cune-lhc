    "overall_summary": "The document is a Permanent Account Number (PAN) Card issued by the Income Tax Department of India to Masoob Alam. This is an identification document used for tax purposes in India, similar to a Social Security Number in the US. The PAN card contains the individual's name, father's name, date of birth (December 18, 2001), and unique PAN number (DXHPA0659G). This document serves as identity verification for the life insurance applicant and provides basic demographic information relevant to underwriting, including confirmation of the applicant's age (21-22 years old based on the DOB). While not a salary slip or invoice, this document is valuable for identity verification purposes in the life insurance application process.",

Request the following additional documentation:\n\n1. Complete medical history and current health status information\n2. Employment verification and income documentation (salary slips, tax returns)\n3. Lifestyle questionnaire to assess risk behaviors\n4. Details on requested coverage amounts and named beneficiaries\n5. Any existing insurance policies\n\nThe applicant's young age (21-22) is favorable from a mortality risk perspective, but additional information is needed to assess financial stability, premium payment capacity, and appropriate coverage amount justification.",
