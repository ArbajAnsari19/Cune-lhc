    "overall_summary": "This document is a comprehensive medical laboratory report for Mr. Hardik Agarwal, a 31-year-old male. The report contains results from multiple tests including complete blood count, lipid profile, liver function tests, kidney function tests, thyroid function, vitamin D levels, urinalysis, and blood glucose measurements. The report was conducted by TATA 1MG OKHLA laboratory. This medical report is highly relevant for life insurance underwriting as it provides detailed health information to assess the applicant's current medical status and potential risks.",

    "final_recommendation": "## Underwriting Recommendation\n\n**Overall Assessment**: Standard rates with potential for slight rating based on multiple minor health concerns.\n\n**Key Considerations**:\n\n1. **Prediabetic Status**: The applicant's HbA1c of 5.9% indicates prediabetes, which slightly increases mortality risk. While not yet diabetic, this warrants monitoring and may justify a minor rating.\n\n2. **Cardiovascular Risk Profile**: The elevated total cholesterol (210 mg/dL), LDL (128 mg/dL), and cholesterol:HDL ratio (4.3) suggest increased cardiovascular risk. This combination of lipid abnormalities may warrant a slight rating.\n\n3. **Liver Function**: Slightly elevated SGPT/ALT (46 U/L) suggests mild liver stress, possibly related to metabolic factors. This is a minor concern but contributes to the overall risk profile.\n\n4. **Vitamin D Deficiency**: The low vitamin D level (19.5 ng/ml) is a common finding and represents a minor health concern that is easily treatable.\n\n5. **Age and Overall Health**: At 31 years old with mostly minor health issues, the applicant remains a generally acceptable risk for life insurance.\n\n**Recommendation**: Offer coverage at standard rates with potential for a small rating (10-25%) based on the combination of prediabetic status and cardiovascular risk factors. Consider requesting follow-up testing in 6-12 months to monitor the prediabetic condition and lipid abnormalities.",
