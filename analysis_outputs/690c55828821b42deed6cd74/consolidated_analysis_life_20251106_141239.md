## Executive Summary

Analysis of seven documents for Hardik Agarwal, a 31-year-old male employed as Assistant Vice President at JM Financial Services. The application shows potential health and identity concerns but demonstrates strong financial capacity for premium payments. Additional clarification is needed regarding medical risks and personal information discrepancies.

## Risk Patterns

Primary risks include metabolic health indicators (Medium), identity verification inconsistencies (Medium), and occupational stress factors (Low). The applicant shows multiple borderline medical results indicating prediabetic condition and cardiovascular risk factors, while maintaining strong financial stability with high income that supports substantial coverage capacity.

## Critical Discrepancies & Concerns

1. **Name inconsistency**
   * Application form lists "Hardil Agarwal" while signature shows "Hardik Agarwal"
   * Identity documents show "Hardik Agarwal" as the correct name

2. **Medical interpretation inconsistencies**
   * Normal TSH level (2.813 ulU/ml) with contradictory interpretations for thyroid conditions
   * Multiple borderline medical values requiring clarification (HbA1c, cholesterol, liver enzymes)

3. **Incomplete medical information**
   * Height and weight measurements not provided for BMI calculation
   * Missing details about hospitalization for fever approximately 2 years ago

4. **Missing insurance application details**
   * No policy term, premium paying term, sum proposed, or installment premium specified
   * Nominee information absent from application form

5. **Limited employment history verification**
   * Salary slips show employment beginning March 2022 (relatively recent)
   * Previous employment history needed to establish long-term stability

## Underwriting Decision

**Request Additional Information**

* Medical discrepancies and borderline health indicators require clarification through additional medical records and possibly follow-up testing
* Name inconsistency between application and supporting documents must be resolved before proceeding
* Complete application details including policy specifications, nominee information, and comprehensive medical questionnaire needed

## Portfolio-Level Insights

* Strong financial qualification with monthly income of ₹238,000 (annual ₹2,856,000) supporting coverage of 5-10x annual income
* Medical lab results indicate multiple borderline health conditions that collectively represent medium risk but require monitoring
* Identity verification is incomplete with discrepancies in name spelling across documents
* Application demonstrates good potential for approval at standard or slightly rated terms pending resolution of identified issues
