    "overall_summary": "This document appears to be an identification document containing basic personal information for Hardik Agarwal, a 29-year-old male born on March 27, 1994, with Aadhaar number 592455052947. This is not a salary slip or invoice but rather an identity verification document that would typically be part of a life insurance application process. The Aadhaar card is India's biometric ID system that serves as proof of identity and residence. While this document provides basic demographic information useful for life insurance underwriting, it lacks medical history, lifestyle factors, occupation details, and financial information necessary for a comprehensive risk assessment.",

Obtain a completed health questionnaire and medical examination results\n2. Request income verification documents to assess premium payment capacity and appropriate coverage amount\n3. Collect occupation details to evaluate occupation-based risks\n4. Gather information on lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise habits)\n5. Request details about desired coverage amount and beneficiary information\n\nThe application cannot proceed until these critical elements are provided for proper risk assessment.",
