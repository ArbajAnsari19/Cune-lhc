    "final_recommendation": "**Recommendation: Request Additional Information**\n\nBased on the incomplete proposal form, I recommend requesting the following before proceeding with underwriting:\n\n1. Complete the missing sections of the application, particularly plan details, premium information, and nominee details\n2. Clarify the name discrepancy (Hardil vs. Hardik Agarwal)\n3. Request more specific occupation details to properly assess occupation-related risks\n4. Obtain medical records related to the hospitalization 2 years ago to confirm it was only for fever and there were no complications\n5. Request height and weight information which is missing from the medical section\n\nThe applicant appears to be a standard risk based on the limited information provided. The annual income of Rs. 3,000,000 should support a reasonable coverage amount (typically 5-10x annual income). The prior hospitalization for fever appears minor but should be verified. Once the missing information is provided, a complete risk assessment can be performed.",
