    "overall_summary": "This document is a salary slip for HARDIK AGARWAL from JM FINANCIAL SERVICES LIMITED for August 2022. The employee holds the position of Assistant Vice President in the Digital Broking department, with a joining date of March 7, 2022. The salary slip shows a gross monthly income of ₹238,000 with deductions totaling ₹65,097, resulting in a net pay of ₹172,903. For life insurance underwriting, this document provides valuable income verification showing substantial financial capacity to pay premiums. The high income level (annual gross of approximately ₹2,856,000) would support a significant life insurance coverage amount (typically 5-10x annual income, suggesting coverage of ₹14-28 million would be appropriate). The employment in financial services as an AVP indicates a white-collar profession with lower occupational hazards. The recent employment start date (5 months before this pay slip) may warrant verification of employment stability.",

    "final_recommendation": "**Approve with standard rates** based on the following financial assessment:\n\n- **Premium Payment Capacity**: Excellent. Monthly net income of ₹172,903 demonstrates strong financial capacity to maintain premium payments for a substantial life insurance policy.\n\n- **Coverage Amount Justification**: Based on the annual gross income of approximately ₹2,856,000, a coverage amount of 5-10x annual income (₹14-28 million) would be appropriate and financially justified.\n\n- **Occupation Risk**: Low risk occupation as Assistant Vice President in Digital Broking at a financial services company. This white-collar position typically does not present elevated mortality risks.\n\n- **Financial Stability**: While the applicant has only been with the current employer for 5 months as of this salary slip, the senior position (AVP) and substantial compensation package suggest career stability and financial responsibility.\n\n**Additional Verification Recommended**: Due to the relatively recent employment start date, consider requesting 1-2 additional months of salary slips to confirm income consistency.",
