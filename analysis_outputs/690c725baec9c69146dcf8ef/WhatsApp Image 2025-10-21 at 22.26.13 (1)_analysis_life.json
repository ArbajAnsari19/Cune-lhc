    "overall_summary": "This document appears to be an identification document containing basic personal information for Hardik Agarwal, a 29-year-old male born on March 27, 1994, with Aadhaar number 592455052947. This is not a salary slip or invoice but rather appears to be an identity verification document that would be part of a life insurance application process. The Aadhaar number is India's unique identification number, similar to a Social Security Number in the US, which is commonly required for insurance applications in India.",

The applicant's age (29) places him in a generally favorable risk category, but comprehensive underwriting requires:\n\n1. Complete medical history and current health status\n2. Lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise habits)\n3. Family medical history\n4. Occupation details and income verification\n5. Desired coverage amount and beneficiary information\n\nRecommend proceeding with standard application process including medical questionnaire, possibly medical examination based on coverage amount requested, and financial justification for the coverage amount.",
