    "overall_summary": "The document appears to be a Permanent Account Number (PAN) card issued by the Income Tax Department of India for HARDIK AGARWAL. This is an identification document that contains the individual's name, father's name, date of birth, PAN number, and issue date. This is not a salary slip or invoice but rather a government-issued identification document that would be used to verify the applicant's identity for life insurance purposes. The PAN card indicates the applicant is 29 years old (born in 1994) and provides official identity verification, which is essential for the life insurance application process.",

Request the following additional documentation:\n\n1. Completed life insurance application form\n2. Medical examination results and health history\n3. Income verification documents (salary slips, tax returns)\n4. Lifestyle questionnaire\n5. Details on requested coverage amount and beneficiary information\n\nThe applicant is 29 years old, which generally falls into a lower-risk age category for life insurance, but comprehensive assessment requires the additional information listed above.",
