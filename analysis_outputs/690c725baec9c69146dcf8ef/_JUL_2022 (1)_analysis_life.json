    "overall_summary": "This document is a salary slip from JM FINANCIAL SERVICES LIMITED for HARDIK AGARWAL for July 2022. The employee holds the position of Assistant Vice President in the Digital Broking department and joined the company on March 7, 2022. The salary slip shows a gross monthly income of ₹238,000 with deductions totaling ₹65,097, resulting in a net pay of ₹172,903. For life insurance underwriting, this document provides valuable income verification showing substantial earning capacity (annual gross income of approximately ₹2,856,000), which supports premium payment ability and justifies a significant coverage amount (typically 5-10x annual income would be ₹14-28 million). The employee's senior position in financial services indicates a professional occupation with likely low physical risk but potentially high stress. The consistent employment (full month worked with no loss of pay) suggests stability, though the relatively recent joining date (4 months before this pay slip) may warrant verification of employment history.",
