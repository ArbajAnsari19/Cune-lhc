    "final_recommendation": "**Recommendation: Request Additional Information**\n\n1. **Medical Information**: Request clarification and medical records regarding the thyroid condition mentioned in the application. The severity, treatment history, and current status should be documented.\n\n2. **Tobacco Use Clarification**: Obtain clarification on the tobacco use history, as there is an inconsistency between stating no tobacco use while also indicating cessation in 2024.\n\n3. **Income Verification**: Request documentation to verify the stated monthly income of ₹180,000, such as tax returns, additional pay stubs, or employer verification, to ensure the coverage amount is appropriate for the applicant's financial situation.\n\n4. **Coverage Amount Justification**: The application does not specify the benefit amount/sum insured. This information is critical for assessing the appropriateness of coverage relative to the applicant's income and needs.\n\nOnce these items are addressed, the application can be reconsidered. The applicant appears to be a young professional with generally good health aside from the potential thyroid condition, which may require standard or slightly rated coverage depending on the specifics of the condition.",
