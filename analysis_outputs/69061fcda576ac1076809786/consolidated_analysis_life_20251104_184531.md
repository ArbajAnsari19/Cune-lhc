## Executive Summary

Analysis of two documents for MASOOB ALAM reveals a life insurance application requiring additional information. The application shows potential concerns regarding health disclosures and income verification that must be addressed before underwriting can proceed.

## Risk Patterns

Primary risks include health disclosure inconsistencies (Medium), income verification gaps (Low), and limited lifestyle information (Medium). The pattern suggests incomplete or potentially contradictory information provided by the applicant, particularly regarding thyroid condition and tobacco use history, which requires clarification for proper risk assessment.

## Critical Discrepancies & Concerns

1. **Thyroid Condition Disclosure**
   * Applicant answered "No" to disease/illness questions but mentioned "Thyroid" in the details section
   * No specifics provided about diagnosis date, severity, treatment plan, or current status

2. **Tobacco Use History**
   * Application indicates "No" for tobacco consumption but lists "2024" as cessation year
   * Clarification needed on actual usage history and duration

3. **Income Verification**
   * Reported monthly income of ₹180,000 as an Engineer lacks supporting documentation
   * Income verification essential for determining appropriate coverage amount

4. **Coverage Details**
   * Application lacks specific benefit amount/sum insured information
   * Insufficient details about desired coverage relative to income and needs

## Underwriting Decision

**Request Additional Information**

* Current documentation provides basic identity verification and preliminary application details but lacks critical health and financial information
* Medical records regarding thyroid condition and clarification on tobacco use history required for risk assessment
* Income verification documentation needed to validate stated monthly income of ₹180,000
* Coverage amount justification and complete payment details must be provided

## Portfolio-Level Insights

* Application shows moderate confidence level (0.8-0.9) for identity verification but lower confidence for risk assessment due to incomplete health and lifestyle information
* Risk mitigation opportunity exists through comprehensive medical examination and detailed health questionnaire
* Applicant's young age (21-23) suggests potential for favorable rates pending clarification of thyroid condition and tobacco use
* Underwriting team should prioritize obtaining complete medical history and income verification before proceeding

## Document-Specific Summary Table
