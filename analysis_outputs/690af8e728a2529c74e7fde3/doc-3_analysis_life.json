    "overall_summary": "This document is a comprehensive health report from TATA 1mg for Masoob Alam, a 24-year-old male. The report contains detailed laboratory test results including complete blood count, lipid profile, liver function tests, kidney function tests, thyroid function tests, and urinalysis. The report appears to be a personal health assessment that would be valuable for life insurance underwriting as it provides extensive information about the applicant's current health status. The report shows mostly normal values with a few minor deviations from reference ranges, which could be relevant for risk assessment.",
