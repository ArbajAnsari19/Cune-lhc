This is an official identification document that contains the individual's unique PAN number (DXHPA0659G), full name (MASOOB ALAM), father's name (AFTAB ALAM), and date of birth (December 18, 2001). For life insurance underwriting, this document serves as primary identification verification and provides basic demographic information about the applicant. The PAN card confirms the applicant is a young adult (21-22 years old depending on current date), which is relevant for age-based risk assessment in life insurance.",

Recommend requesting:\n\n1. Complete medical history and examination reports\n2. Income verification documents (salary slips, tax returns, bank statements)\n3. Lifestyle questionnaire to assess risk behaviors\n4. Occupation details and employment verification\n5. Family medical history\n6. Proposed coverage amount and beneficiary information\n\nThe applicant's young age (21-22) may qualify them for favorable premium rates, but additional documentation is essential to complete a proper risk assessment and determine appropriate coverage levels.",
