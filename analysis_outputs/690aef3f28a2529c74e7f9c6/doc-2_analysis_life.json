    "final_recommendation": "**Recommendation: Request Additional Information**\n\n1. **Medical Information**: Request detailed medical records regarding the thyroid condition, including diagnosis date, treatment plan, medication, and current status. This is critical as thyroid disorders can have varying impacts on mortality risk depending on type and severity.\n\n2. **Income Verification**: Request additional documentation to verify the reported monthly income of ₹180,000, which appears unusually high for a 23-year-old engineer. This verification is essential for:\n   - Confirming premium payment capacity\n   - Validating appropriate coverage amount (typically 5-10x annual income)\n   - Preventing potential fraud or misrepresentation\n\n3. **Tobacco Usage Clarification**: Obtain clarification on tobacco usage history, as the application contains contradictory information (claims no tobacco use but indicates cessation in 2024).\n\n4. **Coverage Amount**: Request information about the desired coverage amount, which is missing from the application but necessary to assess appropriateness relative to income and needs.\n\n5. **Employment Verification**: Obtain employment verification to confirm occupation, income, and employment stability given the applicant's young age.\n\nOnce this additional information is received, a more complete risk assessment can be performed to determine appropriate underwriting action.",
