    "overall_summary": "The document is a Permanent Account Number (PAN) Card issued by the Income Tax Department, Government of India. This is an official identification document that contains the applicant's personal information including name (MASOOB ALAM), father's name (AFTAB ALAM), date of birth (December 18, 2001), and unique PAN number (DXHPA0659G). For life insurance underwriting, this document serves as primary identification verification and provides basic demographic information. The applicant is 22 years old (born in 2001), which is relevant for age-based risk assessment and premium calculation. This is not a salary slip or invoice, but rather an official government identification document essential for verifying the applicant's identity in the life insurance application process.",

Recommend:\n\n1. Request standard medical examination and health questionnaire to assess health risks\n2. Obtain income verification documents (salary slips, tax returns, or bank statements) to assess premium payment capacity and appropriate coverage amount\n3. Request occupation details to evaluate occupation-based risks\n4. Collect information on lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, dangerous activities)\n5. Gather details on desired coverage amount and beneficiary information\n\nThe application process should continue once these additional documents are provided for a comprehensive risk assessment.",
