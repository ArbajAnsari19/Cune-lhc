    "final_recommendation": "## Underwriting Recommendation\n\n**Recommendation: Standard rates with potential for preferred classification pending additional information**\n\nThe applicant is a 24-year-old male with generally favorable health indicators. The comprehensive health report shows mostly normal results with a few minor abnormalities that are unlikely to significantly impact mortality risk:\n\n1. **Cardiovascular Health**: Normal cholesterol levels overall, though HDL is below recommended levels (29 mg/dL vs. ≥39.9 mg/dL reference). This represents a modest cardiovascular risk factor but is mitigated by the applicant's young age and otherwise normal lipid panel.\n\n2. **Metabolic Health**: Normal glucose metabolism with fasting glucose of 73 mg/dL and HbA1c of 4.8%, both well within normal ranges.\n\n3. **Liver Function**: Minor elevations in bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase warrant monitoring but are likely benign given normal SGOT/SGPT values.\n\n4. **Kidney Function**: All parameters within normal limits.\n\n5. **Thyroid Function**: All parameters within normal limits.\n\nThe slightly elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit values could be physiological or related to dehydration at the time of testing, rather than indicating pathology.\n\nRecommend obtaining additional information about:\n- Family history of cardiovascular disease or other hereditary conditions\n- Lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise habits)\n- Height and weight for BMI calculation\n- Blood pressure readings\n\nAbsent any concerning findings from this additional information, the applicant appears to be a good candidate for standard or potentially preferred life insurance rates given his young age and largely favorable health profile.",
