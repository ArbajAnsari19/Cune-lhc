While the tenure with the current employer is relatively short (approximately 6 months at the time of this salary slip), the senior designation suggests career stability and established professional experience.\n\nThe occupation in financial services (Digital Broking) presents minimal physical hazards but may involve moderate stress levels. No unusual deductions or health-related concerns are evident from the salary information.\n\nRecommend proceeding with standard rates based on the strong financial profile, assuming all other underwriting requirements (medical examination, lifestyle questionnaire, etc.) are satisfactory.",
