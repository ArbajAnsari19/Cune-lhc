    "overall_summary": "This document is a salary slip from JM FINANCIAL for employee HARDIK AGARWAL for August 2022. The employee holds the position of Assistant Vice President in the Digital Broking department, with a date of joining of March 7, 2022. The salary slip shows a gross monthly income of ₹238,000 with deductions totaling ₹65,097, resulting in a net pay of ₹172,903. For life insurance underwriting purposes, this document provides valuable income verification showing substantial earning capacity (annual gross income of approximately ₹2,856,000), confirming the applicant's ability to pay insurance premiums. The position as Assistant Vice President in Digital Broking indicates a white-collar profession with likely low occupational hazards. The employment appears stable, though relatively recent (5 months at the time of this salary slip). The high income level suggests the applicant could qualify for significant coverage amounts (typically 5-10x annual income, potentially ₹14-28 million), and demonstrates financial stability that may correlate with lower mortality risk factors.",
