## Executive Summary

Analysis of seven documents for Hardik Agarwal, a 31-year-old Assistant Vice President at JM Financial. The application shows potential health and financial stability but requires additional information regarding medical history details and coverage specifications to complete underwriting assessment.

## Risk Patterns

Primary risks include health indicators (Medium), limited medical history documentation (Medium), and employment stability (Low). Health concerns center around pre-diabetic status (HbA1c 5.9%), elevated cholesterol levels, and vitamin D deficiency, while financial documents demonstrate strong income but relatively recent employment tenure.

## Critical Discrepancies & Concerns

1. **Name inconsistency across documents**
   * Applicant referred to as both "Hardik Agarwal" and "Hardil Agarwal" in different documents

2. **Medical disclosure gaps**
   * Application mentions hospitalization for fever but lacks details on diagnosis and treatment
   * No height/weight data provided for BMI calculation
   * Limited family medical history with no ages provided for living family members

3. **Incomplete application details**
   * Missing policy specifications including coverage amount, term, premium payment details
   * No nominee/beneficiary information provided
   * Insufficient lifestyle information (smoking status, alcohol consumption, exercise habits)

4. **Verification limitations**
   * Employment history limited to current position (started March 2022)
   * No information about previous employment to establish longer career stability

## Underwriting Decision

**Request Additional Information**
* Current medical information is insufficient for complete risk assessment despite lab results showing pre-diabetic indicators and elevated cholesterol
* Request complete medical questionnaire, height/weight data, details of previous hospitalization, and family medical history with ages
* Obtain policy specifications including coverage amount to assess appropriateness relative to ₹3,000,000 annual income

## Portfolio-Level Insights

* Moderate confidence (70-85%) in application assessment based on comprehensive lab results but incomplete personal and policy information
* Strong financial profile with monthly gross income of ₹238,000 supports substantial coverage capacity (5-10x annual income)
* Medical lab results require follow-up to determine if pre-diabetic status and cholesterol issues are being addressed through treatment
* Recommend standard rates with possible rating based on pre-diabetic status pending additional medical information
