Request complete medical information including height, weight, and BMI calculations\n2. Clarify the name discrepancy (Hardil vs. Hardik Agarwal)\n3. Obtain details about the hospitalization for fever 2 years ago including diagnosis, treatment, and current status\n4. Request complete family medical history with ages of living family members\n5. Obtain plan details and coverage amount to assess appropriateness relative to income\n6. Request nominee/beneficiary information\n\nThe applicant's income of ₹3,000,000 annually suggests good premium payment capacity, but we need the requested coverage amount to determine if it's within reasonable multiples of annual income (typically 5-10x).",
