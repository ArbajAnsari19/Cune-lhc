    "overall_summary": "The document appears to be a Permanent Account Number (PAN) card issued by the Income Tax Department of India for Hardik Agarwal. This is an identification document rather than a salary slip or invoice. The PAN card contains the individual's name, father's name, date of birth, PAN number, and issue date. For life insurance underwriting, this document serves as identity verification and can confirm basic personal details of the applicant. The applicant is 29 years old (born in 1994), which places them in a relatively low-risk age category for life insurance.",

While the applicant's age of 29 is favorable for life insurance pricing, additional documentation is required to assess health status, lifestyle factors, occupation, income, and coverage needs. Request standard medical examination, income verification, and lifestyle questionnaire before proceeding with underwriting decision.",
