    "property_assessment": "N/A",
    "final_recommendation": "## Underwriting Recommendation\n\n**Recommendation: Standard rates with possible rating or additional premium based on pre-diabetic status and lipid profile**\n\nThe applicant shows several health concerns that warrant careful consideration for life insurance underwriting:\n\n1. **Pre-diabetic Status**: HbA1c of 5.9% falls in the pre-diabetes range, indicating increased risk for developing diabetes. While fasting glucose is normal at 86 mg/dL, the elevated HbA1c suggests longer-term glucose control issues.\n\n2. **Cardiovascular Risk Factors**: Elevated total cholesterol (210 mg/dL) and unfavorable cholesterol ratios (Cholesterol:HDL ratio of 4.3) indicate increased cardiovascular risk. This may impact mortality risk assessment.\n\n3. **Mild Inflammation**: Elevated ESR (18 mm/hr) suggests possible underlying inflammation, though the cause is not specified in the lab results.\n\n4. **Vitamin D Deficiency**: Level of 19.5 ng/ml indicates deficiency, which has been associated with various health issues including immune function and bone health.\n\n**Actions Recommended:**\n- Consider a rating based on the pre-diabetic status and lipid profile\n- Request medical records from primary care physician to determine if these conditions are being treated\n- Consider requesting a follow-up HbA1c test in 3-6 months to establish trend\n- Evaluate family history of diabetes and cardiovascular disease\n- Consider standard rates with an exclusion rider or a table rating of 1-2 depending on company guidelines for pre-diabetes",
