    "final_recommendation": "**Recommendation: Standard Rate with Additional Review**\n\nBased on the medical report for Masoob Alam, a 24-year-old male, I recommend offering life insurance at standard rates pending additional review of the following concerns:\n\n1. **Cardiovascular Risk Assessment**: The applicant's low HDL cholesterol (29 mg/dL) indicates increased cardiovascular risk. Request a cardiovascular risk assessment or additional lipid panels to establish if this is a persistent condition.\n\n2. **Liver Function Evaluation**: The elevated bilirubin levels (total: 1.60 mg/dL, indirect: 1.11 mg/dL) and alkaline phosphatase (122 U/L) suggest potential liver function issues. Request medical records or additional liver function tests to determine if this is a temporary condition or indicative of underlying liver disease.\n\n3. **Hematological Assessment**: Slightly elevated hemoglobin, hematocrit, and PDW warrant further investigation to rule out polycythemia or other blood disorders.\n\nThe applicant's young age (24) and otherwise normal test results (normal glucose metabolism, kidney function, and thyroid function) are positive factors. No lifestyle risk factors (smoking, alcohol consumption) are documented in the available information.\n\nIf additional tests confirm these abnormalities are temporary or clinically insignificant, standard rates would be appropriate. If further testing reveals underlying conditions, a rating adjustment may be necessary.",
