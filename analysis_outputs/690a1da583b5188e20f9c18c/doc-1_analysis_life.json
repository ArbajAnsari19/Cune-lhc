    "overall_summary": "The document is an Aadhaar card issued by the Unique Identification Authority of India (Government of India) for Masoob Alam. This is a national identity document containing personal identification information including name, date of birth, gender, address, and unique identification numbers (Aadhaar and Virtual ID). The applicant is a 22-year-old male residing in Ranchi, Jharkhand. This document serves as identity verification for the life insurance application process but does not contain any medical history, coverage details, or lifestyle information directly relevant to life insurance underwriting.",

Recommend requesting:\n\n1. Complete medical history and examination results\n2. Income verification documents to assess premium payment capacity and appropriate coverage amount\n3. Lifestyle questionnaire to evaluate risk factors\n4. Beneficiary information and relationship details\n5. Occupation details to assess occupation-based risks\n\nThe applicant's young age (22) is favorable from a mortality risk perspective, but additional information is needed to make a complete underwriting decision.",
