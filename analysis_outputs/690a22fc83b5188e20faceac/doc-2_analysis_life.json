    "overall_summary": "This document is a life insurance application form for Masoob Alam, a 23-year-old male (DOB: 18/12/2001) who is applying for new insurance coverage. The applicant is single, works as an Engineer with a reported monthly gross income of ₹180,000, and has nominated his father, Aftab Alam, as the beneficiary. The applicant has selected Plan A with individual sum insured option. The health details indicate the applicant is in good health, does not consume tobacco or alcohol currently (with indication of having stopped tobacco use in 2024), and has no occupational hazards. There is a mention of 'Thyroid' in the health details section, though the applicant has answered 'No' to all health condition questions, creating some ambiguity about whether this is a current condition. The insurance period is set from 20/09/2025 to 21/10/2026.",
