    "overall_summary": "The document is an Aadhaar card (India's national identification document) for Masoob Alam, a 22-year-old male born on December 18, 2001. The Aadhaar card is issued by the Government of India through the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI). It contains the individual's personal information including name, date of birth, gender, address, and a unique 12-digit Aadhaar number (783296048167) along with a virtual ID. The document serves as identity verification and can be used to support a life insurance application by confirming the applicant's identity, age, and residence details. This is not a salary slip or invoice but a government-issued identification document that provides basic demographic information relevant for life insurance underwriting.",

Recommend requesting:\n\n1. Medical history and current health status information\n2. Income verification documents (salary slips, tax returns) to assess premium payment capacity\n3. Occupation details to evaluate occupation-based mortality risks\n4. Lifestyle information (smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity)\n5. Family medical history\n6. Desired coverage amount and beneficiary information\n\nThe applicant's young age (22) is favorable from a mortality risk perspective, but additional information is essential to properly evaluate insurability and appropriate coverage levels.",
