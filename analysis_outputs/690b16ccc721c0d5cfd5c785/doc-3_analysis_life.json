    "final_recommendation": "## Underwriting Recommendation\n\nBased on the comprehensive health report for Masoob Alam (24/Male), I recommend **Standard Plus** rating for life insurance coverage with the following considerations:\n\n### Positive Factors:\n- Young age (24 years)\n- Normal blood glucose and HbA1c (4.8%, well within normal range)\n- Normal kidney function tests\n- Normal thyroid function tests\n- Normal blood pressure (as no abnormal readings were noted)\n- No evidence of diabetes, hypertension, or other major chronic conditions\n\n### Risk Factors to Consider:\n- Low HDL cholesterol (29 mg/dL) indicates increased cardiovascular risk, though total cholesterol (137 mg/dL) is favorable\n- Mildly elevated liver function tests (bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase) warrant monitoring but are likely benign\n- Slightly elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit may require follow-up to rule out polycythemia\n\n### Additional Recommendations:\n1. Request follow-up on elevated bilirubin to determine if this is Gilbert's syndrome (benign) or indicates other liver issues\n2. Consider obtaining additional lifestyle information (exercise habits, diet, smoking status, alcohol consumption)\n3. Request height and weight measurements to calculate BMI\n4. Consider a follow-up lipid panel in 6 months to monitor HDL levels\n\nOverall, the applicant appears to be in good health with minor abnormalities that do not significantly impact mortality risk.",
