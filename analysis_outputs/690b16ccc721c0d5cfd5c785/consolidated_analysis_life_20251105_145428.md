## Executive Summary

Analysis of four documents for Masoob Alam, a 23-24 year old male engineer from India. The application requires additional information due to inconsistent medical reporting and income verification needs before underwriting can proceed.

## Risk Patterns

Primary risks include medical disclosure inconsistencies (Medium), income verification concerns (Medium), and cardiovascular risk indicators (Low). The applicant has reported a thyroid condition inconsistently across documents, while also showing some abnormal health markers in lab results. The reported monthly income of ₹180,000 appears unusually high for a young engineer and requires verification.

## Critical Discrepancies & Concerns

1. **Thyroid condition reporting**
   * Applicant indicated "No" to medical conditions questions but listed "Thyroid" under ailments/treatments
   * Medical report shows normal thyroid function tests, contradicting the reported condition

2. **Tobacco use history**
   * Applicant marked "No" to tobacco consumption but indicated stopping tobacco use in 2024
   * No details provided on duration, quantity, or exact cessation date

3. **Income verification concerns**
   * Reported monthly income of ₹180,000 (₹2.16M annually) appears high for a young engineer
   * No supporting documentation provided to verify stated income

4. **Cardiovascular risk indicators**
   * Low HDL cholesterol (29 mg/dL) below reference range (≥39.9 mg/dL)
   * No blood pressure readings or BMI data provided for comprehensive assessment

5. **Liver function abnormalities**
   * Elevated total bilirubin (1.60 mg/dL), indirect bilirubin (1.11 mg/dL), and alkaline phosphatase (122 U/L)
   * May indicate mild liver issues requiring follow-up

## Underwriting Decision

**Request Additional Information**

* Medical inconsistencies and abnormal lab values require clarification before proceeding with underwriting
* Income verification documentation is essential to validate the reported monthly income of ₹180,000
* Request comprehensive medical history with focus on thyroid condition and tobacco use details, plus follow-up on elevated liver function tests

## Portfolio-Level Insights

* Overall confidence in application is moderate (0.7-0.85) with sufficient identity verification but significant gaps in medical and financial information
* The applicant's young age (23-24) is favorable from a mortality risk perspective but requires verification of financial stability to support premium payments
* Multiple identification documents (Aadhaar card, PAN card) provide strong identity verification but lack of comprehensive medical and financial documentation prevents final assessment
* Recommend standard medical examination including thyroid function tests, liver panel, and cardiovascular assessment

## Document-Specific Summary Table

| Document | Primary Purpose | Key Finding | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| Aadhaar Card | Identity verification | Confirms identity and residence in Ranchi, Jharkhand | Accept as valid ID proof |
| Life Insurance Application | Coverage request details | Reports thyroid condition inconsistently and indicates recent tobacco cessation | Request clarification on medical disclosures |
| TATA 1mg Health Report | Medical assessment | Shows abnormal liver values and low HDL cholesterol | Follow up on liver function and cardiovascular risk |
| PAN Card | Tax identification | Confirms identity for tax purposes | Accept as secondary ID verification |

Overall, the application shows potential for standard or standard plus rating pending resolution of medical inconsistencies and income verification.
