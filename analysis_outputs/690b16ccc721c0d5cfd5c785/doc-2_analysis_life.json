The inconsistent reporting raises concerns about full disclosure of medical history.\n\n2. **Income Verification**: Request income verification documentation (tax returns, employment verification) as the reported monthly income of ₹180,000 (₹2.16 million annually) appears high for a young engineer who recently completed B.Tech education.\n\n3. **Tobacco Use History**: Seek clarification on tobacco use history, including duration of use, quantity, and exact cessation date, as there are inconsistencies in the application.\n\n4. **Medical Examination**: Consider requiring a medical examination including thyroid function tests to assess current health status and verify the reported thyroid condition.\n\n5. **Coverage Amount Assessment**: Once income is verified, assess appropriate coverage amount based on income level and financial obligations.\n\nThe application should be held pending until these clarifications are received and verified.",
