# Consolidated Underwriting Analysis: Hardik Agarwal

## Executive Summary

The application package for Hardik Agarwal (31-year-old male) consists of four documents: comprehensive medical laboratory test results, a partially completed life insurance proposal form, an Aadhaar card (government ID), and a PAN card (tax ID). The medical tests indicate several metabolic concerns including prediabetes (HbA1c 5.9%) and elevated cholesterol levels, suggesting moderate cardiovascular risk factors despite the applicant's young age. 

Significant discrepancies exist across the documentation, including inconsistent name spelling (Hardik vs. Hardil), age discrepancy (29 vs. 31), and concerning future-dated documents (medical reports dated 2025, signature dated October 2025). The application package is notably incomplete, missing critical underwriting information such as complete medical history, lifestyle factors, family medical history, and insurance coverage details. These inconsistencies and gaps substantially impair our ability to make a definitive underwriting decision.

## Aggregated Risk Profile

  - Elevated HbA1c (5.9%) indicating prediabetes
  - Elevated total cholesterol (210 mg/dL)

  - Elevated non-HDL cholesterol (162 mg/dL)
  - Elevated cholesterol to HDL ratio (4.3)

  - Vitamin D deficiency (19.5 ng/ml)
  - Low Hematocrit (39.0%)
  - Low MCV (79.4 fL)

### Risk Distribution Statistics

- Low Severity: 9 risks

## Critical Discrepancies & Concerns

1. **Document Dating Issues**
   - Medical reports dated June 25, 2025 (future date)
   - Insurance form declaration signed with date 20-10-2025 (future date)
   - These future dates raise serious concerns about document authenticity

2. **Identity Inconsistencies**
   - Name appears as "Hardil Agarwal" in proposal form but "Hardik Agarwal" in signature, medical reports, and ID documents
   - Age discrepancy: 29 years old per Aadhaar card (DOB: March 27, 1994) vs. 31 years old in medical reports
   - These inconsistencies require verification of the applicant's true identity

3. **Medical History Contradictions**
   - Proposal form indicates "No" for hospitalization but then provides details of hospitalization 2 years ago for fever
   - This contradiction raises concerns about disclosure accuracy

4. **Severely Incomplete Application**
   - Missing critical underwriting information across all documents
   - No comprehensive medical questionnaire responses
   - No details on insurance coverage amount or beneficiaries

## Consolidated Recommendations

### Overall Decision: **REQUEST ADDITIONAL INFORMATION**

The application cannot be processed in its current state due to significant discrepancies, future-dated documents, and missing critical information. We cannot make a definitive underwriting decision without resolving these issues.

### Required Actions

1. **Verify Document Authenticity**
   - Request properly dated medical reports and application forms
   - Investigate reason for future dates on multiple documents
   - Confirm identity with additional verification (photo ID match)

2. **Obtain Complete Application Package**
   - Complete insurance proposal form with all sections filled
   - Insurance plan details and coverage amount
   - Beneficiary information
   - Premium payment details

3. **Request Additional Medical Information**
   - Complete medical questionnaire
   - Height and weight measurements
   - Family medical history
   - Detailed explanation of hospitalization history
   - Current medications list
   - Lifestyle information (smoking, alcohol, exercise habits)

### Preliminary Risk Assessment

If identity and documentation issues are resolved, the applicant would likely qualify for **Standard with Rating (+50 to +75)** based on:
- Prediabetic status (HbA1c 5.9%)
- Multiple lipid abnormalities
- Young age (favorable factor)

## Portfolio-Level Insights

### Confidence Assessment
- **Overall confidence in application package: LOW (45%)**
  - Medical data appears comprehensive but future-dated (65% confidence)
  - Proposal form is incomplete with contradictions (65% confidence)
  - ID documents appear legitimate but don't provide underwriting information (90% confidence)
  - PAN card provides minimal relevant information (30% confidence)

### Red Flags
1. Future-dated documents across multiple submissions
2. Identity inconsistencies between documents
3. Contradictory medical history information
4. Severely incomplete application materials

### Risk Mitigation Opportunities
1. Request medical re-examination with proper dating and identity verification
2. Implement additional identity verification steps
3. Require complete medical questionnaire with physician statement
4. Consider requesting attending physician statement regarding hospitalization history

### Next Steps for Underwriting Team
1. Issue formal request for additional information with detailed checklist
2. Flag application for potential fraud investigation if future dates cannot be explained
3. Once complete information is received, reassess metabolic risk factors
4. Consider medical director review of prediabetic status and lipid profile
