    "overall_summary": "This document appears to be a basic identification document containing personal information for Hardik Agarwal, a 29-year-old male born on March 27, 1994, with Aadhaar number 592455052947. This is not a salary slip or invoice, but rather an identity verification document that provides basic demographic information relevant for a life insurance application. The Aadhaar number indicates this is likely from India, as Aadhaar is India's biometric ID system. While this document provides essential identity verification, it lacks comprehensive information needed for a complete life insurance underwriting assessment.",

While this confirms the applicant's identity and age (29 years), it is insufficient for a comprehensive life insurance underwriting decision. \n\nRecommend requesting:\n1. Complete medical history and current health status\n2. Lifestyle information (smoking status, alcohol consumption, exercise habits)\n3. Occupation details and income verification\n4. Family medical history\n5. Desired coverage amount and beneficiary information\n\nThe applicant's age (29) is favorable for life insurance from an age-based risk perspective, but a complete risk assessment requires the additional information listed above.",
