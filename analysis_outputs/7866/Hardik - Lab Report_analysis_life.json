    "overall_summary": "This document is a comprehensive medical laboratory report for Mr. Hardik Agarwal, a 31-year-old male, conducted by TATA 1MG Labs. The report includes a complete blood count (CBC), lipid profile, liver function tests, kidney function tests, thyroid function test, vitamin D levels, blood glucose tests including HbA1c, and urinalysis. The report indicates several health concerns including borderline high cholesterol levels (210 mg/dL), elevated HbA1c (5.9%, indicating pre-diabetes risk), vitamin D deficiency (19.5 ng/ml), and slightly elevated ESR (18 mm/hr). This medical information is highly relevant for life insurance underwriting as it provides insight into the applicant's current health status, potential chronic conditions, and future health risks.",

    "final_recommendation": "## Underwriting Recommendation\n\n**Rating Classification: Standard with possible rating or exclusion**\n\nBased on the laboratory results for Mr. Hardik Agarwal, I recommend proceeding with caution due to multiple moderate health concerns that may impact mortality risk:\n\n1. **Pre-diabetes Risk**: The elevated HbA1c of 5.9% indicates the applicant is at risk for developing diabetes. While not yet diabetic, this represents an increased mortality risk that should be factored into underwriting.\n\n2. **Cardiovascular Risk Factors**: The borderline high total cholesterol (210 mg/dL) and elevated LDL cholesterol (128 mg/dL) suggest increased cardiovascular risk. The Cholesterol:HDL ratio of 4.3 further supports this concern.\n\n3. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - The elevated ESR (18 mm/hr) may indicate underlying inflammation\n   - Vitamin D deficiency (19.5 ng/ml) is present but is a relatively minor concern\n   - Slightly elevated liver enzyme SGPT/ALT (46) warrants monitoring\n\n**Recommendation Actions**:\n1. Consider a standard rating with possible slight table rating based on the combination of pre-diabetes risk and elevated cholesterol\n2. Request follow-up testing in 6 months to monitor HbA1c and lipid levels\n3. Consider requesting additional information about family history of diabetes and cardiovascular disease\n4. Proceed with normal premium structure but consider exclusions for diabetes-related complications if policy terms allow",
