    "overall_summary": "The document is an Aadhaar card, which is India's national identification document issued by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI). This is not a salary slip or invoice, but rather an identity verification document. The Aadhaar card belongs to an individual who is the son of Hirdesh Kumar Agarwal, residing in Pilkhuwa, Hapur, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, India. The document contains the individual's Aadhaar number (592455052947) and residential address. For life insurance underwriting purposes, this document primarily serves as identity verification and address proof for the applicant.",

Request the following additional documentation:\n\n1. Completed life insurance application form with full name, date of birth, and gender details\n2. Medical examination reports and health questionnaire\n3. Income proof documents (salary slips, tax returns, or bank statements)\n4. Lifestyle questionnaire\n5. Family medical history\n6. Beneficiary designation form\n\nThe Aadhaar card can be used to verify the applicant's identity and address, but substantial additional information is required to properly assess mortality risk and coverage needs.",
