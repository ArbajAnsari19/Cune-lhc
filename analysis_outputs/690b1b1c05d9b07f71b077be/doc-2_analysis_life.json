This inconsistency in health declarations requires clarification.\n\n2. **Tobacco usage history**: Request details about previous tobacco consumption habits including duration, frequency, and type of tobacco products used before quitting in 2024.\n\n3. **Income verification**: While the monthly income of Rs. 180,000 appears sufficient to support premium payments, request income documentation to verify the stated amount.\n\n4. **Medical examination**: Consider requiring a medical examination with thyroid function tests to assess current thyroid status and overall health.\n\nThe application shows no other significant health concerns, and the applicant's age (23), occupation (Engineer), and lifestyle factors (non-drinker, recently quit smoking) are generally favorable risk factors. Once the thyroid condition is properly assessed and documented, standard rates may be appropriate if the condition is well-controlled.",
