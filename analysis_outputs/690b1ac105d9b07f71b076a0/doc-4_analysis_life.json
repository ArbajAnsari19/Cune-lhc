    "overall_summary": "This document is a Permanent Account Number (PAN) Card issued by the Income Tax Department of the Government of India to Masoob Alam. The PAN card serves as an important identification document in India and contains the individual's unique PAN number (DXHPA0659G), full name, father's name (Aftab Alam), and date of birth (December 18, 2001). For life insurance purposes, this document provides identity verification and confirms the applicant's age as 21-22 years old (depending on current date). The PAN card helps establish the applicant's identity for KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements but does not provide information about medical history, lifestyle factors, income, or coverage needs.",

Request the following additional documentation:\n\n1. Completed life insurance application form with medical history disclosure\n2. Income proof documents (salary slips, tax returns) to assess premium payment capacity and appropriate coverage amount\n3. Medical examination reports based on age and requested coverage amount\n4. Occupation details to assess occupation-based risk factors\n5. Lifestyle questionnaire to evaluate risk behaviors\n6. Beneficiary information and relationship to the applicant\n\nThe applicant's young age (21-22) may qualify for standard or preferred rates pending medical and lifestyle evaluation. However, comprehensive assessment requires the additional documentation listed above.",
