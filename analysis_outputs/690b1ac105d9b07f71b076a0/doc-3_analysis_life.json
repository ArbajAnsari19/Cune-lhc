    "final_recommendation": "## Underwriting Recommendation\n\n**Overall Assessment**: Standard rates with potential for slight rating adjustment\n\n**Rationale**:\n- The applicant is a young 24-year-old male with generally good health indicators\n- Several minor laboratory abnormalities are present but none indicate serious underlying conditions\n- The most significant finding is the low HDL cholesterol (29 mg/dL) and elevated cholesterol:HDL ratio (4.7), which represents a moderate cardiovascular risk factor\n- Mild liver function abnormalities (elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase) warrant monitoring but are not severe\n\n**Recommended Actions**:\n1. Proceed with standard rates with consideration for a slight rating adjustment based on the cardiovascular risk profile\n2. Request additional information about:\n   - Family history of cardiovascular disease\n   - Current exercise habits and lifestyle\n   - Smoking, alcohol consumption, and other risk behaviors\n   - Any previous medical diagnoses or treatments\n3. Consider requesting a follow-up lipid panel in 3-6 months to monitor HDL levels\n4. Document the mild liver function abnormalities for future reference\n\n**Note**: The applicant's young age (24) is a positive factor that partially mitigates the cardiovascular risk findings.",
