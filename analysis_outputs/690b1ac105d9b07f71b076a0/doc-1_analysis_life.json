    "overall_summary": "The extracted data appears to be from an Aadhaar card, which is India's national identification document. The document contains personal identification information for Masoob Alam, a 22-year-old male born on December 18, 2001. The document includes his Aadhaar number (783296048167), Virtual ID (9159120491242473), and residential address in Ranchi, Jharkhand, India. This is not a salary slip or invoice but rather an identity verification document that provides basic demographic information relevant for a life insurance application. The document confirms the applicant's identity, age, gender, and residence, which are fundamental elements for life insurance underwriting.",

However, this document alone is insufficient for complete life insurance underwriting.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. Request medical examination and health history to assess mortality risk\n2. Obtain income verification documents to assess premium payment capacity and appropriate coverage amount\n3. Request lifestyle questionnaire to evaluate risk behaviors\n4. Verify occupation details to assess occupation-related risks\n5. Confirm beneficiary information and relationship to the applicant\n\nThe application can proceed to the next underwriting stage with identity verification complete, but additional documentation is required before final approval.",
