    "overall_summary": "The document is a Permanent Account Number (PAN) Card issued by the Income Tax Department of India for MASOOB ALAM. This is an identification document that serves as a tax identification number in India, similar to a Social Security Number in the US. The PAN card contains the individual's name (MASOOB ALAM), father's name (AFTAB ALAM), date of birth (December 18, 2001), and unique PAN number (DXHPA0659G). For life insurance underwriting purposes, this document provides basic identity verification and confirms the applicant's age as 22 years old (born in 2001), which is relevant for age-based risk assessment and premium calculations.",

Request the following additional documentation:\n\n1. Completed life insurance application form with health declarations\n2. Medical examination results or health records\n3. Income verification documents (salary slips, tax returns, or bank statements)\n4. Lifestyle questionnaire to assess risk behaviors\n5. Details about desired coverage amount and beneficiary information\n\nThe applicant's young age (21-22 years) is generally favorable for life insurance rates, but additional information is needed to properly assess health status, lifestyle factors, financial capacity, and coverage needs before making a final underwriting decision.",
