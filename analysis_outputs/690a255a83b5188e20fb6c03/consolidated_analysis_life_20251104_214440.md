## Executive Summary

Analysis of four documents for Masoob Alam reveals a 22-23 year old male engineer with potential health concerns and identity verification needs. The application requires additional information to clarify discrepancies in health status, tobacco use history, and income verification before an underwriting decision can be made.

## Risk Patterns

Primary risks include health disclosure inconsistencies (Medium), identity verification concerns (Medium), and financial verification needs (Low). The applicant's medical report shows several mild abnormalities requiring further evaluation, while the application form contains contradictory health and lifestyle information. The young age of the applicant (22-23) presents minimal mortality risk but raises questions about financial stability and insurance needs.

## Critical Discrepancies & Concerns

1. Health disclosure inconsistencies
   * Application indicates "good health with no diseases" but mentions thyroid condition in ailment details
   * Medical report shows elevated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and low HDL cholesterol requiring follow-up

2. Tobacco use reporting conflicts
   * Application states no tobacco consumption but indicates cessation in 2024
   * Clarification needed on tobacco use history and duration

3. Income verification concerns
   * Reported monthly income of ₹180,000 appears unusually high for a 23-year-old engineer
   * No supporting financial documentation provided to verify income claims

4. Multiple individuals on identification documents
   * Both Masoob Alam (applicant) and Aftab Alam (father/beneficiary) appear on identification documents
   * Relationship clarified in application form but requires verification

5. Medical information gaps
   * Missing height/weight/BMI data in medical report
   * No blood pressure measurements or lifestyle factors documented

## Underwriting Decision

**Request Additional Information**

* Medical clarification needed regarding thyroid condition mentioned in application and follow-up on abnormal liver function tests and low HDL cholesterol
* Income verification documentation required to substantiate the reported monthly income of ₹180,000
* Tobacco use history clarification needed to resolve contradictory information in the application
* Complete health questionnaire and lifestyle assessment required to properly evaluate mortality risk

## Portfolio-Level Insights

* Overall confidence in application is moderate (0.76 average confidence score) with sufficient identity verification but significant health and financial information gaps
* The applicant's young age (22-23) is favorable for life insurance pricing, but medical abnormalities require further investigation before final risk assessment
* Cross-document analysis reveals potential non-disclosure issues regarding health conditions and tobacco use that must be addressed
* Recommend standard approval with potential rating adjustments pending receipt of requested information and medical evaluation of liver function and cardiovascular risk factors

## Document-Specific Summary Table

| Document | Primary Purpose | Key Finding | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| Aadhaar Card | Identity verification | Confirms identity of Masoob Alam (22) with address information | Verify relationship with Aftab Alam listed on document |
| Life Insurance Application | Coverage request | Reports good health despite thyroid mention and tobacco use inconsistency | Clarify health disclosures and tobacco history |
| Health Report (TATA 1mg Labs) | Medical assessment | Shows elevated liver enzymes, bilirubin, and low HDL cholesterol | Request follow-up testing for liver function and cardiovascular risk |
| PAN Card | Tax identification | Confirms identity and age (born December 18, 2001) | Accept as valid identification document |

Overall, the application shows potential for approval at standard or slightly rated terms pending resolution of health disclosures and income verification.
