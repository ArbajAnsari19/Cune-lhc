    "overall_summary": "The document appears to be an Aadhaar card (India's national identity document) for Masoob Alam, a 22-year-old male born on December 18, 2001. The extracted data includes personal identification information such as name, gender, date of birth, Aadhaar number, and virtual ID. The document also contains address information for what appears to be a relative named Aftab Alam residing in Ranchi, Jharkhand. This is not a salary slip or invoice but rather an identity verification document that provides basic demographic information relevant for life insurance underwriting, including age and gender which are primary factors in determining life insurance premiums and eligibility.",

Request a completed health questionnaire and medical records if required based on coverage amount.\n\n3. **Verify Financial Information**: Request income verification documents (salary slips, tax returns) to assess premium payment capacity and justify coverage amount, especially given the applicant's young age (22).\n\n4. **Beneficiary Information**: Request clear documentation of intended beneficiaries and their relationship to the insured.\n\n5. **Occupation Details**: Request information about the applicant's occupation and employment status to complete risk assessment.",
