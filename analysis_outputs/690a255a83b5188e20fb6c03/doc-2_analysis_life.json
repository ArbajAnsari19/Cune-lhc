This verification is important to ensure appropriate coverage amount and premium payment capacity.\n\n4. **Coverage amount assessment**: Once income is verified, assess if the requested coverage amount (not specified in the extracted data) aligns with the applicant's income level and needs.\n\n5. **Occupation details**: Request more specific information about the engineering role to confirm no occupational hazards exist.\n\nOnce these clarifications are received, the application can be reassessed for underwriting decision.",
