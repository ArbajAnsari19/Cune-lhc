    "overall_summary": "This document is a comprehensive health report from TATA 1mg Labs for Masoob Alam, a 24-year-old male. The report contains detailed blood work results, including complete blood count, lipid profile, liver function tests, kidney function tests, thyroid function tests, and urinalysis. The report is structured as a 'PERSONAL HEALTH SMART REPORT' with multiple sections including summary for doctors, wellbeing index, important parameters, wellness recommendations, and references. This medical information is valuable for life insurance underwriting as it provides current health status, identifies potential medical conditions, and helps assess mortality risk.",

    "final_recommendation": "**Recommendation: Standard Approval with Additional Review**\n\nBased on the comprehensive health report for Masoob Alam, a 24-year-old male, I recommend standard approval for life insurance with additional review of the following concerns:\n\n1. **Cardiovascular Risk Assessment**: The applicant's low HDL cholesterol (29 mg/dL) indicates increased cardiovascular risk. Request a cardiovascular risk assessment or follow-up lipid panel to determine if this is a persistent issue.\n\n2. **Liver Function Evaluation**: Elevated total bilirubin (1.60 mg/dL), indirect bilirubin (1.11 mg/dL), and alkaline phosphatase (122 U/L) suggest potential liver function issues. Request medical records to determine if these are isolated findings or indicative of an underlying condition.\n\n3. **Hematological Assessment**: Slightly elevated hemoglobin (17.3 g/dL) and hematocrit (51.4%) warrant monitoring. Consider requesting additional hematology records to rule out polycythemia or other blood disorders.\n\nOverall, the applicant is young (24) with mostly normal test results, including normal glucose levels, HbA1c, thyroid function, and kidney function. The identified abnormalities are mild to moderate and may not significantly impact mortality risk, but should be evaluated further before final underwriting decision.",
