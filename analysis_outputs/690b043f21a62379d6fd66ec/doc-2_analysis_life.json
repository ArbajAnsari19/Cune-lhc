This could include tax returns, employment contract, or additional pay stubs.\n\n3. **Tobacco Use History**: Clarify the history of tobacco use including duration, frequency, and type of tobacco products used before cessation in 2024.\n\n4. **Coverage Amount Justification**: Request clarification on the desired coverage amount (not specified in the extracted data) to ensure it aligns with financial needs and income level.\n\nOnce this information is received, a more accurate risk assessment can be completed. The thyroid condition may require additional rating depending on its severity and control status. The income verification is particularly important to ensure the coverage amount requested is appropriate and the premium payment capacity is accurately assessed.",
