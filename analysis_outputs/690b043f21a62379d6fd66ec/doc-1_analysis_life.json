    "overall_summary": "The document appears to be an Aadhaar card (India's national identification document) for Masoob Alam, a 21-year-old male born on December 18, 2001. The document contains personal identification information including name, date of birth, gender, Aadhaar number, virtual ID, and residential address in Ranchi, Jharkhand, India. This is not a salary slip or invoice but rather an identity verification document that provides basic demographic information relevant for a life insurance application. The document helps verify the applicant's identity, age, and residence, which are fundamental factors in life insurance underwriting.",

The following additional information is required:\n\n1. **Medical history and health questionnaire** to assess health risks\n2. **Occupation details** to evaluate occupational hazards and income stability\n3. **Income verification documents** (salary slips, tax returns) to determine premium payment capacity and appropriate coverage amount\n4. **Lifestyle information** to assess risk behaviors\n5. **Beneficiary details** to understand insurable interest\n\nThe application should be held pending receipt of this critical information. The Aadhaar verification appears legitimate, confirming the applicant's identity and age, which provides a foundation for further underwriting.",
