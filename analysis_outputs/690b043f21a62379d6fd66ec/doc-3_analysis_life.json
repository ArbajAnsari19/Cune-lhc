    "final_recommendation": "# Final Recommendation\n\n**Recommendation: Standard Approval with Additional Review**\n\nBased on the comprehensive health report for Masoob Alam, a 24-year-old male, I recommend standard approval for life insurance with additional review of the following findings:\n\n## Key Considerations\n\n1. **Cardiovascular Risk Factors**:\n   - Low HDL cholesterol (29 mg/dL) and elevated Cholesterol:HDL ratio (4.7) indicate moderate cardiovascular risk that should be monitored\n   - All other lipid parameters are within normal limits\n   - Blood pressure data is not available\n\n2. **Liver Function**:\n   - Slightly elevated total and indirect bilirubin with normal liver enzymes may indicate Gilbert's syndrome (a benign condition) rather than liver disease\n   - Alkaline phosphatase is only marginally elevated\n\n3. **Blood Parameters**:\n   - Slightly elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit are minor findings that may be physiological\n\n4. **Positive Health Indicators**:\n   - Normal blood glucose and HbA1c indicate no diabetes risk\n   - Normal kidney function tests\n   - Normal thyroid function\n   - Normal urinalysis\n\n## Underwriting Considerations\n\nThe applicant is young (24) with generally favorable health parameters. The minor abnormalities noted do not suggest significant health risks that would impact mortality. The low HDL cholesterol warrants attention but is a modifiable risk factor.\n\nRecommend standard rates with possible consideration for a follow-up lipid panel in 6-12 months to monitor cardiovascular risk factors.",
